# Monte-Carlo-Simulations
This is a simple Implementation of importance sampling and Metropolis algorithms. Similar version of importance sampling based can be found in the excellent article by Monte Carlo Simulations with Python by Patrick Hanbury. I just tried to implement the algorithm Patrick explained in the article beautifully. There is an article by Rahul Agarwal which provides good intuition on MCMC.
